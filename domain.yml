    text: Université Des Mascareignes, UDM for close friends was founded in 2012.
      This happened after a merger between the IST (Institut Supérieur de Technologie)
      at Rose-Hill and Swami Dayanand Institute of Management (SDIM) at Pamplemousses.
      It is thus the fourth and the youngest public University in Mauritius, which
      provides tertiary education in Engineering, Sustainable Development, Banking
      and Finance, Management and Information Technology. It has a close working collaboration
      with the Université de Limoges, France. The Université Des Mascareignes (UdM)
      currently has 1,325 students who are enrolled in different programmes at both
      undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The bulk of the degrees are dual certificates.
      one from UdM and another from the Université de Limoges in France, according
      to the European LMD system. This allows students to earn degrees which are internationally
      recognized.
